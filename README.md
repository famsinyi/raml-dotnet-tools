:source-highlighter: prettify

:!numbered:

These are support classes for the Visual Studio extension https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-dotnet-tools[RAML Tools for .NET].

These classes are used in the generated code and also in the RAML extraction process from an ASP.Net Core app.
The nuget package is installed into the user project when adding a RAML contract, generating a client proxy or enabling RAML metadata from the Visual Studio extension for .Net Core projects
