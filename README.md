The RAML .Net Tools allows developers to easily integrate and consume APIs that expose a RAML or an OAS (OpenAPI / Swagger) definition, or create a new ASP.NET Core or WebAPI implementations using a contract first approach from a RAML or an OAS definition.

See <http://raml.org> for information on RAML (RESTful API Markup Language).

The tools are provided as a Visual Studio extension, allowing simple and natural integration of RAML/OAS into a normal development workflow.

A single installation package provides support for both client, service code-generation and RAML extraction scenarios.
